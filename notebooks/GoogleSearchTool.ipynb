    "The Google Custom Search Engine (CSE) API allows you to programmatically search the web. You'll need a Google account to obtain an API key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Step-by-Step Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create/Access Google Account**\n",
    "   - Visit [Google Account Sign-in](https://accounts.google.com/signin)\n",
    "   - Create a new account or sign in to existing one\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate API Key**\n",
    "   - Navigate to: [Google Custom Search API Introduction](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/introduction)\n",
    "   - Click the **\"Get a Key\"** button in the middle of the screen\n",
    "   - Enter a project name (e.g., \"StrandsGoogleSearchTool\")\n",
    "   - Wait for key generation (takes a few seconds)\n",
    "   - Click **\"Show Key\"** and copy the API key\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Secure Storage**\n",
    "   - Create a new text file on your system\n",
    "   - Paste the API key into the file\n",
