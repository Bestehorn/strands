    "### 🏆 What You've Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you've successfully:\n",
    "- ✅ Transformed specialized agents into callable tools\n",
    "- ✅ Built an orchestrator agent that delegates work\n",
    "- ✅ Created a complete customer service system\n",
    "- ✅ Handled complex multi-topic inquiries\n",
    "- ✅ Applied best practices for agent tool design\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏢 The Power of Hierarchical Agent Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "You now have the skills to:\n",
    "- **Build teams of specialized AI agents** that work together\n",
    "- **Create orchestrator agents** that route tasks intelligently\n",
    "- **Scale your systems** by adding new specialists\n",
    "- **Handle complex queries** through delegation\n",
    "- **Model real-world organizations** with AI\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent focuses on its expertise\n",
    "2. **Clear Documentation**: Good docstrings help orchestrators route correctly\n",
    "3. **Focused Prompts**: Specialized agents perform better than generalists\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Always handle failures gracefully\n",
    "5. **Testing Strategy**: Test individual agents before integration\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Where to Go From Here\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider exploring:\n",
    "- **Adding More Specialists**: Shipping agents, loyalty program agents, etc.\n",
    "- **Nested Hierarchies**: Department heads managing team leads\n",
    "- **State Management**: Tracking customer history across interactions\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Caching and parallel processing\n",
    "- **Production Deployment**: Scaling your customer service system\n",

    "### 🌟 Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You're ready to:\n",
    "1. Design hierarchical agent systems for your use cases\n",
    "2. Build specialized agents for different domains\n",
    "3. Create intelligent orchestration logic\n",
    "4. Deploy multi-agent systems in production\n",
    "5. Lead AI architecture initiatives\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎊 Final Thoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Agents as Tools\" pattern transforms how we build AI systems. By creating teams of specialized agents coordinated by intelligent orchestrators, you can tackle complex problems that would overwhelm a single agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: Great AI systems are built one specialized agent at a time!\n",
