    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **Custom Mesh Swarms** in the Strands framework! This notebook teaches you how to build sophisticated swarm architectures where specialized agents communicate directly with each other. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll create a customer feedback analysis swarm with research, creative, critical, and summarizer agents working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Build mesh swarm architectures from scratch\n",
    "- Create specialized agents with distinct roles\n",
    "- Implement SharedMemory for agent communication\n",
    "- Execute multi-phase swarm processing\n",
    "- Analyze customer feedback with collective intelligence\n",
    "- Compare custom swarms vs built-in swarm tool\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🕸️ What is Mesh Swarm Architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mesh Architecture** means every agent can communicate with every other agent:\n",
    "- **Direct Communication**: Agents share insights immediately\n",
    "- **Collective Knowledge**: All agents benefit from each other's discoveries\n",
    "- **Specialized Roles**: Each agent has a specific expertise\n",
    "- **Multi-Phase Processing**: Agents refine their work based on peer feedback\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Why Build Custom Swarms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom swarms offer advanced capabilities:\n",
    "- **Specialized System Prompts**: Tailor each agent for specific roles\n",
    "- **Fine-grained Control**: Manage exactly how agents interact\n",
    "- **Complex Workflows**: Multi-phase processing with feedback loops\n",
    "- **Custom Memory Systems**: Implement sophisticated knowledge sharing\n",
    "- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize for your specific use case"
