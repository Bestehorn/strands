    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **Advanced Swarm Systems** in the Strands framework! This notebook demonstrates how to build enterprise-ready swarm applications that combine collective intelligence with document analysis, workflows, and production patterns. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll create a sophisticated document analysis swarm that handles real-world business intelligence tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Combine swarms with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems\n",
    "- Build production-ready swarm architectures with error handling\n",
    "- Integrate swarms with workflow orchestration\n",
    "- Implement monitoring and observability for swarms\n",
    "- Create scalable document analysis systems\n",
    "- Apply enterprise deployment patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏭 What Makes Swarms Production-Ready?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enterprise swarms** require:\n",
    "- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery\n",
    "- **Performance Monitoring**: Track swarm health and performance\n",
    "- **Scalable Architecture**: Handle increasing workloads\n",
    "- **Integration Capabilities**: Work with existing systems\n",
    "- **Observability**: Detailed logging and metrics\n",
    "- **Security**: Protect sensitive data and operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔄 Why Combine Swarms with RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination offers powerful capabilities:\n",
    "- **Knowledge-Grounded Analysis**: Swarms work with factual document data\n",
    "- **Specialized Document Processing**: Different agents handle different document types\n",
    "- **Collective Document Intelligence**: Multiple perspectives on complex documents\n",
    "- **Scalable Research**: Process large document collections efficiently\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Insights**: Combine document knowledge with agent expertise"
