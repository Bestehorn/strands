    "\n",
    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **Swarm Intelligence** in the Strands framework! This notebook introduces you to the fascinating world of multi-agent swarms where multiple AI agents work together to solve complex problems through collective intelligence. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll build your first AI swarm that outperforms any single agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Understand swarm intelligence and collective AI\n",
    "- Use the built-in `swarm` tool for instant multi-agent systems\n",
    "- Explore different coordination patterns (collaborative, competitive, hybrid)\n",
    "- Build a market research swarm that analyzes business opportunities\n",
    "- Compare swarm performance vs single agent performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🐜 What is Swarm Intelligence?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Swarm Intelligence** is inspired by nature:\n",
    "- **Ant colonies** find optimal paths through pheromone trails\n",
    "- **Bird flocks** navigate complex environments together  \n",
    "- **Bee colonies** make collective decisions about new hive locations\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI systems, swarm intelligence means:\n",
    "- **Multiple agents** working on the same problem\n",
    "- **Collective decision-making** that's smarter than individual choices\n",
    "- **Emergent behavior** where the whole exceeds the sum of parts\n",
    "- **Distributed problem-solving** with shared knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Why Use AI Swarms?\n",
    "\n",
    "Swarms offer powerful advantages:\n",
    "- **Enhanced Accuracy**: Multiple perspectives reduce errors\n",
    "- **Creative Solutions**: Different agents contribute diverse ideas\n",
    "- **Robust Decision-Making**: Less susceptible to individual agent limitations\n",
    "- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously\n",
    "- **Scalable Intelligence**: Easy to add more agents for complex problems"
