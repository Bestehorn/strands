    "Welcome to the world of **local AI models**! This notebook demonstrates how to run powerful AI agents entirely on your own machine using Ollama and the Strands Agents SDK. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll be able to create agents that run completely offline, cost nothing after setup, and keep your data 100% private.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this hands-on tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Set up Ollama for local model execution\n",
    "- Create Strands agents using local models\n",
    "- Compare different open-source models\n",
    "- Understand when to use local vs cloud models\n",
    "- Build privacy-first AI applications\n",
    "- Save money on AI development\n",
    "\n",
    "### üè† Why Run Models Locally?\n",
    "\n",
    "Running AI models locally offers several advantages:\n",
    "- **üí∞ Cost**: Zero API fees after initial setup\n",
    "- **üîí Privacy**: Your data never leaves your machine\n",
    "- **‚ö° Speed**: No network latency for API calls\n",
    "- **üåê Offline**: Works without internet connection\n",
    "- **üõ†Ô∏è Control**: Full control over model behavior"
