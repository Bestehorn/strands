    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **tools and agents** in the Strands framework! This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to creating AI agents that can perform complex tasks by integrating with external tools and services. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll understand how to build powerful, tool-equipped agents.\n",

    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Create agents with custom behaviors and personalities\n",
    "- Build custom tools using the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- Understand type hints and their importance for tools\n",
    "- Implement conversation context and memory\n",
    "- Monitor agent performance and handle errors\n",
    "- Create production-ready tool-equipped agents\n",

    "### üöÄ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tools = Superpowers**: Tools transform conversational agents into action-oriented assistants\n",
    "2. **Type Hints Matter**: Proper type hints ensure reliable tool execution\n",
    "3. **Context is King**: Agents maintain conversation history for natural interactions\n",
    "4. **Error Handling**: Robust agents handle edge cases gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Clear Docstrings**: Help agents understand when to use each tool\n",
    "2. **Type Annotations**: Always include type hints for parameters\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**: Handle edge cases within your tools\n",
    "4. **System Prompts**: Design clear instructions for agent behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÆ What's Next?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've mastered tools and agents, you're ready to:\n",
    "1. **Build Complex Tools**: Integrate with APIs, databases, and external services\n",
    "2. **Create Specialized Agents**: Domain-specific assistants for your needs\n",
    "3. **Implement Workflows**: Chain multiple agents and tools together\n",
    "4. **Deploy to Production**: Build real-world applications\n",
