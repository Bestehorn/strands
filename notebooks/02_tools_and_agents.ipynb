    "Welcome to this comprehensive tutorial on **tools and agents** in the Strands framework! This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to creating AI agents that can perform complex tasks by integrating with external tools and services. By the end of this 10-minute tutorial, you'll understand how to build powerful, tool-equipped agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "- Create agents with custom behaviors and personalities\n",
    "- Build custom tools using the `@tool` decorator\n",
    "- Understand type hints and their importance for tools\n",
    "- Implement conversation context and memory\n",
    "- Monitor agent performance and handle errors\n",
    "- Create production-ready tool-equipped agents\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ What Are Tools?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** in Strands are functions that agents can use to:\n",
    "- Perform calculations or data processing\n",
    "- Access external APIs and services\n",
    "- Interact with databases or file systems\n",
    "- Execute any custom logic you define\n",

      "# Python List Comprehension\n",
      "\n",
      "A list comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It's one of Python's most distinctive features and can make your code more readable and efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Basic Syntax\n",
      "\n",
      "The basic syntax is:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "new_list = [expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "Where:\n",
      "- `expression` is what you want to include in the list\n",
      "- `item` is the variable representing each element in the iterable\n",
      "- `iterable` is any Python iterable (list, tuple, string, etc.)\n",
      "- `condition` is optional and filters items (only include items that satisfy the condition)\n",
      "\n",
      "## Simple Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "### Creating a list of squares:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
      "# Result: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Filtering even numbers:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "even_numbers = [x for x in range(20) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
      "# Result: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Transforming strings:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\n",
      "upper_names = [name.upper() for name in names]\n",
      "# Result: ['ALICE', 'BOB', 'CHARLIE']\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "## More Advanced Examples\n",
      "\n",
      "### Using conditional expressions:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "parity = ['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in numbers]\n",
      "# Result: ['odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd']\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Nested list comprehension:\n",
      "```python\n",
      "matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
      "flattened = [num for row in matrix for num in row]\n",
      "# Result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
