    "The important details in this piece of code are the following:\n",

    " - the @tool marker/decorator for the function indicates that this is a tool that agents can use. Without this decorator, the tools are not used even if they are passed to the Agent using the \"tools\" parameter.\n",
    " - The type hints are important. By default, agents are passed str variables. This means without the type hint \"n:int\" in the header of the function, agents would pass a value such as \"5\" (str) to the function. This will cause type errors or undesired behavior. Through the type hint, the agent knows that the value needs to be converted to int, e.g., \"5\" => int(\"5\") => 5, before passing a value to this function.\n",
    "\n",
    " While agents sometimes can handle errors that occur when calling functions with wrongly formatted input, this will cause extra cycles for the inference as the agent first tries to use the tool, then waits for a response, discovers an errors, handles the error and then passes the input again to the function. Hence, providing proper type hints is highly recommended for tool definitions.   "

    " - The 2nd question asks for a random number without specification of a range. The agent will use the defined defaults from the function in the code and generate a number between 1 and 100.\n",
    " - The 3rd question asks for the factorial. Normally, the function would be passed a str and not an int as required by the function. Through the use of Python type hints, one can provide the agent with information which format the input should have. In this case, the str is converted into int before it is passed to the factorial function.\n",
