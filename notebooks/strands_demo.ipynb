    "### üîß Key Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "The code above demonstrates several critical concepts for tool development:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **@tool Decorator**\n",
    "- The `@tool` decorator is **essential** for agent tool recognition\n",
    "- Without this decorator, functions are ignored even when passed to the Agent's `tools` parameter\n",
    "- This decorator registers the function in the agent's tool registry\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Type Hints for Parameter Conversion**\n",
    "- **Critical for proper functionality**: Agents receive string inputs by default\n",
    "- Type hints like `n:int` instruct the agent to convert string inputs to the correct type\n",
    "- Example conversion: `\"5\"` (string) ‚Üí `int(\"5\")` ‚Üí `5` (integer)\n",
    "- **Without type hints**: Functions may receive incorrect data types, causing errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Performance Impact**\n",
    "- **With proper type hints**: Direct, efficient tool execution\n",
    "- **Without type hints**: Multiple inference cycles due to error handling:\n",
    "  1. Agent attempts tool use with wrong type\n",
    "  2. Function returns error\n",
    "  3. Agent analyzes error and retries\n",
    "  4. Additional API calls and latency\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Best Practices**\n",
    "- Always include descriptive docstrings for tool functions\n",
    "- Use clear, specific type hints for all parameters\n",
    "- Handle edge cases within your tool functions\n",
    "- Provide meaningful default values where appropriate\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° **Pro Tip**: Proper type hints significantly improve agent performance and reduce API costs by minimizing failed tool calls."

    " - The 3rd question asks for the factorial. Normally, the function would be passed a str and not an int as required by the function. Through the use of Python type hints, one can provide the agent with information which format the input should have. In this case, the str is converted into int before it is passed to the factorial function.\n",
